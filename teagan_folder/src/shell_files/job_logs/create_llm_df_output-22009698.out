We are studying non-polarized variants of polarized social media posts.

- A "non-polarized" post does NOT clearly express a strong, divisive attitude
  or opinion.
- It avoids strong "us vs them" dynamics and aggressive attacks.
- It may still discuss the same topics and groups, but in a neutral, descriptive,
  or balanced way.

        You will be given a social media post that is labeled as POLARIZED (1),
        meaning it expresses a strong, divisive attitude.
